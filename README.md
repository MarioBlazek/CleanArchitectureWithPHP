# Clean Architecture in PHP

This repository holds the code for the Case Study at the end of the book
[The Clean Architecture in PHP](http://leanpub.com/cleanphp). The book provides explaination
of how the code is setup and why decisions were made, as well as the ramifications of those
decisions. However, the code may be of some value without the book.
